Like-my-Timeline
================

This is a small hack that I developed on my B'day when I had too many b'day wishes on my wall (approx. 60),
and I actually wanted to like each of the post, and comment "thank you" on it, individually.

I came with this Python script which does it for! 

This script will crawl, users entire newsfeed, and will get the posts which are actual b'day wishes, and then it
will like the post and comment "thank you" on it.
